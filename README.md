Project's Title: Todo List Web App
Project Description: 
    This is a Web App using react 17 (Although I have updated to react 18 in my system, I haven't figure out how to modify codes to suit react 18. Will do that later.)

    This app aim to realize functions as below:
    1. Add a task
    2. Click done of a task
    3. Delete a task
    4. Select all task done
    5. Delete all task

    Why I used the technologies I used?
    I had a two weeks challenge with Matt, and the required language to use to finish the project was React. And I found the react course which taught how to write a todo list, is just right information I need. 

    How to Install and Run the Project?
    * Node.js
    * React.js
    * Webpack (create-react-app includes)
    * ES6
